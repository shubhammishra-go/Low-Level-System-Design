# Low-Level-System-Design

Low-level design (LLD) is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms. Overall, the data organization may be defined during requirement analysis and then refined during data design work. Post-build, each component is specified in detail.

The LLD phase is the stage where the actual software components are designed.

During the detailed phase the logical and functional design is done and the design of application structure is developed during the high-level design phase.

# Why LLD ?

The goal of LLD or a low-level design document (LLDD) is to give the internal logical design of the actual program code. Low-level design is created based on the high-level design. LLD describes the class diagrams with the methods and relations between classes and program specs. It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document.

A good low-level design document makes the program easy to develop when proper analysis is utilized to create a low-level design document. The code can then be developed directly from the low-level design document with minimal debugging and testing. Other advantages include lower cost and easier maintenance.



# Process of Designing Low Level Systems

1. Identifying the objects in a system;

2. Defining relationships between objects;

3. Establishing the interface of each object;

4. Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages;

We need a standard method/tool to document all this information; for this purpose we use `UML`. 
UML can be considered as the successor of object-oriented (OO) analysis and design. UML is powerful enough to represent all the concepts that exist in object-oriented analysis and design. UML diagrams are a representation of object-oriented concepts only. Thus, before learning UML, it is essential to understand OO concepts.


# About UML

The unified modeling language (UML) is a general-purpose visual modeling language that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

# Why UML ?

It helps software developers visualize, construct, and document new software systems and blueprints. UML is used to create static structure diagrams based on a variety of engineering practices that have proven to be successful in the creation of complex systems.

- Modeling business and similar processes.
- Analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems.
- Document the decisions that you have made.
- Provides template that guides you in constructing a system.
- Helps you visualize a system.
- Permits you to specify the structure or behavior of a system.


# Types of UML Diagrams

UML provides a standard notation for many types of diagrams which can be roughly divided into three main groups: `behavior diagrams`, `interaction diagrams`, and `structure diagrams`. 

![alt text](image-2.png)


- `Structural diagrams` :::  Structure diagrams represent the `static aspects of the system`. It emphasizes the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems. For example, the component diagram describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components. 

for examples : `Class diagram` , `Component diagram` .


- `Behavioral diagrams` ::: Behavior diagrams represent the `dynamic aspect of the system`. It emphasizes what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. As an example, the activity diagram describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system. 

for examples : `Activity diagram` , `Use case diagram` .


- `Interaction diagrams` ::: Interaction diagrams, a subset of behavior diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled. For example, the sequence diagram shows how objects communicate with each other regarding a sequence of messages. 

for examples : `Sequence diagram` , `Communication diagram` .



we will discusss just Class Diagram & Use case diagram.


# Class Diagram

Class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a `type of static structure diagram` that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. 

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling, translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling. The classes in a class diagram represent both the main elements, interactions in the application, and the classes to be programmed. 

![alt text](image-8.png)


In the diagram, classes are represented with boxes that contain `three compartments`: 

- The top compartment contains the `name` of the class. It is printed in bold and centered, and the `first letter is capitalized`.

- The middle compartment contains the `attributes` or `Variables` of the class. They are left-aligned and the `first letter is lowercase`.

- The bottom compartment contains the `operations` or `functions` the class can execute. They are also left-aligned and the `first letter is lowercase`.

`Note ::: ` colon (:) used to represents return type of functions/variables.


## Visibility

To specify the visibility of a class member (i.e. any attribute or method), these notations must be placed before the member's name.

![alt text](image-4.png) 

- (+) Public
- (-) Private
- (#) Protected
- (~) Package
- (/) Derived

## Scope

The UML specifies two types of scope for members: instance and class. The class name appears an underlined concatenation of the instance name (if any), a colon (':'), and the actual class name.

- `Instance members` are scoped to a specific instance.
     - Attribute values may vary between instances
     - Method invocation may affect the instance's state (i.e. change instance's attributes)

- `Class members` are commonly recognized as "static" in many programming languages. The scope end is the class itself. 
     - Attribute values are equal for all instances
     - Method invocation does not affect the classifier's state.

![alt text](image-7.png)

To indicate a classifier scope for a member, its name must be underlined. Otherwise, instance scope is assumed by default. 



# Relationships

A relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class and object diagrams. UML defines the following relationships.

![alt text](image-9.png)

we will discuss each & every relations.


## Generalization/Inheritance

It indicates that one of the two related classes (the subclass) is considered to be a specialized form of the other (the super type) and the superclass is considered a Generalization of the subclass. In practice, this means that any instance of the subtype is also an instance of the superclass. An exemplary tree of generalizations of this form is found in biological classification: humans are a subclass of simian, which is a subclass of mammal, and so on. The relationship is most easily understood by the phrase 'an A is a B' (a human is a mammal, a mammal is an animal).


```symbolic of realization           (subclass) ________â–» (superclass)```

The generalization relationship is also known as the inheritance or ```"is a"``` relationship. 

Generalization is the `name of the relationship`. Inheritance is the `mechanism` that the generalization relationship represents.


## Association

Association defines a relationship between classes of objects that allows one object instance to cause another to perform an action on its behalf. This relationship is structural, because it specifies that objects of one kind are connected to objects of another and does not represent behaviour.

Dictionary meaning :  `the act of connecting thing with another thing.`


Association relationship is a structural relationship in which different objects are linked within the system. It exhibits a binary relationship between the objects representing an activity. It depicts the relationship between objects, such as a teacher, can be associated with multiple teachers.

It is represented by a `line` between the classes followed by an arrow that navigates the direction, and when the arrow is on both sides, it is then called a bidirectional association. `We can specify the multiplicity of an association by adding the adornments on the line that will denote the association.`

![alt text](image-21.png)


An association represents a family of structural links. 
A `binary association` is represented as a solid line between two classes. 
A `reflexive association` is a binary association between the class and itself. 
An association between more than two classes is represented as a diamond connected with a solid line to each of the associated classes. 
An association between three classes is a `ternary association`. 
An association between more classes is called an `n-ary association`. 


An association can be named, and the ends of an association can be adorned with role names, aggregation indicators, multiplicity, visibility, navigability and other properties. 
The dot notation for example allows to represent with a little dot on the side of one class that the association end is owned by the other side.


![alt text](image-15.png)


There are three types of association: 

`simple association`, `shared aggregation`, `composite aggregation (composition)`. 

An association can be navigable in one or more directions. 

The navigability does not have to be explicitly specified. 

An open-headed arrow on the side of a class documents that the class can be reached efficiently at run-time from the opposite side. 

A unidirectional navigation is shown with a little cross on the association line on the side of the class that cannot be reached. 
For instance, a flight class is associated with a plane class bi-directionally. 


There are 3 types of following represtenations of associations.

`A solid line connecting two classes`. But they are further classified.

![alt text](image-14.png)

`Top:` A bidirectional association.

`Middle:` An association is bidirectional, although it may be limited to just one direction by adorning some end with an arrowhead pointing to the direction of traversal.

`Bottom:` Association is prohibited.

The objects that are related via the association are considered to act in a role with respect to the association, if object's current state in the active situation allows the other associated objects to use the object in the manner specified by the role. A role can be used to distinguish two objects of the same class when describing its use in the context of the association. A role describes the public aspects of an object with respect to an association.

The ends of the association can have all the characteristics of a property:

  -  They can have a multiplicity, expressed by a lower and an upper limit in the form of "lowerLimit..upperLimit".
  - You can have a name.
  -  You can declare a visibility.
  - You can specify whether the end of the association is ordered and / or unique.


## Aggregation

Dictionary meaning : `the collection of related items of content so that they can be displayed or linked to`
OR 
`a cluster of things that have come or been brought together.`


Aggregation is a variant of the `"has a"` association relationship; aggregation is more specific than association. It is an association that represents a `part-whole` or `part-of relationship`. As shown in the image, a Professor 'has a' class to teach. As a type of association, an aggregation can be named and have the same adornments that an association can. However, an aggregation may not involve more than two classes; it must be a binary association. Furthermore, there is hardly a difference between aggregations and associations during implementation, and the diagram may skip aggregation relations altogether.

![alt text](image-16.png)

Class diagram showing Aggregation between two classes. Here, a Professor 'has a' class to teach.


Aggregation can occur when a class is a collection or container of other classes, `but the contained classes do not have a strong lifecycle dependency on the container. The contents of the container still exist when the container is destroyed. `


In UML, it is graphically represented as a `hollow diamond` shape on the containing class with a single line that connects it to the contained class. The aggregate is semantically an extended object that is treated as a unit in many operations, although physically it is made of several lesser objects. 

Aggregation is a `subset of association`, is a collection of different things. It represents has a relationship. `It is more specific than an association`. It describes a part-whole or part-of relationship. It is a binary association, i.e., it only involves two classes. `It is a kind of relationship in which the child is independent of its parent`.


Another Example:

Here we are considering a car and a wheel example. A car cannot move without a wheel. But the wheel can be independently used with the bike, scooter, cycle, or any other vehicle. The wheel object can exist without the car object, which proves to be an aggregation relationship.

![alt text](image-17.png)


So, In aggregation, the object may only contain a reference or pointer to the object (and `not have lifetime responsibility` for it).
Therefore, Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.


## Composition

Dictionary Meaning : `the parts that form something; the way in which the parts of something are arranged`


The composite aggregation (colloquially called composition) relationship is a stronger form of aggregation where the `aggregate controls the lifecycle of the elements it aggregates`. 

The graphical representation is a `filled diamond shape` on the containing class end of the line that connect contained class(es) to the containing class. 


The composition is a part of aggregation, and it portrays [to show something] the whole-part relationship. It depicts dependency between a composite (parent) and its parts (children), which means that if the composite is discarded, so will its parts get deleted. It exists between similar objects.


![alt text](image-19.png)

As you can see from the example given below, the composition association relationship connects the Person class with Brain class, Heart class, and Legs class. If the person is destroyed, the brain, heart, and legs will also get discarded.



### Differences between Composition and Aggregation

The composition and aggregation are two subsets of association. In both of the cases, the object of one class is owned by the object of another class; the only difference is that in composition, the child does not exist independently of its parent, whereas in aggregation, the child is not dependent on its parent i.e., standalone. An aggregation is a special form of association, and composition is the special form of aggregation.


![alt text](image-20.png)


::: `Composition relationship` ::: 

- When attempting to represent real-world whole-part relationships, e.g. an engine is a part of a car.
- When the container is destroyed, the contents are also destroyed, e.g. a university and its departments.



::: `Aggregation relationship` :::

- When representing a software or database relationship, e.g. car model engine ENG01 is part of a car model CM01, as the engine, ENG01, maybe also part of a different car model.
- When the container is destroyed, the contents are usually not destroyed, e.g. a professor has students; when the professor leaves the university the students do not leave along with the professor.

Thus the aggregation relationship is often "catalog" containment to distinguish it from composition's "physical" containment. UML 2 does not specify any semantic for the aggregation compared to the simple association. 


![alt text](image-18.png)

Two class diagrams. The diagram on top shows Composition between two classes: A Car has exactly one Carburetor, and a Carburetor is a part of one Car. Carburetors cannot exist as separate parts, detached from a specific car. 

The diagram on bottom shows Aggregation between two classes: A Pond has zero or more Ducks, and a Duck has at most one Pond (at a time). Duck can exist separately from a Pond, e.g. it can live near a lake. When we destroy a Pond we usually do not kill all the Ducks.



## Realization/Implementation

A realization relationship is a relationship between two model elements, in which one model element (the client) realizes (implements or executes) the behavior that the other model element (the supplier) specifies.
 
Several clients can realize the behavior of a single supplier. 

Typically, realization relationships do not have names. If you name a realization, the name is displayed beside to the realization connector in the diagram.

As the following figure illustrates, a realization is displayed in the diagram editor as a `dashed line with an unfilled arrowhead [hollow triangle]` that points from the client (realizes the behavior) to the supplier (specifies the behavior).

![alt text](image-22.png)

`symbolic of realization           (implementer) -------â–» (interface)`


The realization relationship does not have names. It is mostly found in the interfaces.


A plain arrow head is used on the interface end of the dashed line that connects it to its users. In component diagrams, the ball-and-socket graphic convention is used (implementors expose a ball or lollipop, whereas users show a socket). 

Realizations can only be shown on class or component diagrams. A realization is a relationship between classes, interfaces, components and packages that connects a client element with a supplier element. A realization relationship between classes/components and interfaces shows that the class/component realizes the operations offered by the interface. 


`Realization is one of the phase of an implementation .`

OR 

`Implimentation is a whole process. Realization process is a part/step of whole implimentation process.`


::: Realization can be used ::: 

- A component is realized by a set of classifiers that provide its implementation.
- A collaboration instance contains the objects and messages that are needed to implement the behaviors that a use case specifies.
- To model stepwise refinement, optimizations, transformations, templates, model synthesis, framework composition, etc.


will discuss more about realization further.
